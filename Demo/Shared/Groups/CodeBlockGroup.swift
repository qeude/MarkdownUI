        Use a group to collect multiple views into a single instance,
        without affecting the layout of those views. After creating a
        group, any modifier you apply to the group affects all of that
        group’s members.

        ```swift
        Group {
            Text("SwiftUI")
            Text("Combine")
            Text("Swift System")
        }
        .font(.headline)
        ```
